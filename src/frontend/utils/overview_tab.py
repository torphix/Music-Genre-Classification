    Given a dataset of 30 second music clips and various numerical features extracted from the data we seek to classify 
    the music clips into the respective musical genre. <br/>
    To commence we perform an intial cursory data analysis exploring the best numerical feature types that can be extracted from the audio clips. <br/>
    Following several data cleaning techniques, an in depth disucssion into the cleaning, normalisation and features are provided under the data tab. <br/>
    We employ classical machine learning techniques such as KNN, linear regression and  Kmeans clustering to establish a suitable baseline. <br/>
    We iteratively improve upon the established baseline using various neural network architechtures such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385">resnets Kaimin He et al.</a> <br/>
    Our various experiments with different architechtures and the impact on selected metrics are discussed and analysed under the models tab. <br/>
